                    <p style="color:brown; background-color: burlywood;"> My full name is Harlen Davis James Lopez</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p style="color:brown; background-color: burlywood;"> I was born and raised in Placerville California, it is the home of the gold rush and referred to as "Hangtown".</p>
                    <p style="color:brown; background-color: burlywood;">I enjoy woodworking, i built custom guitars for a ong time. I used hand tools and powertools to include a CNC
                         machine to complete the operations. Additionally, I enjoy playing board/card games with my friends and of course video games.</p>
                    <p style="color:brown; background-color: burlywood;"> Prior to Code Fellows, I was in the Carpenters Union, I was in their apprenticeship program for 2 years. I
                         realized that i did not want to continue in this field as i feel that im more tech focused. Prior to that, I spent seven years in the Army as a Human Intelligence 
                         Collector. In this MOS i was responsible for conducting interviews for the collection, reporting and disimenation of intelligence products. I primarily filled the role 
                         of an analyst in both HUMINT and Counter Intelligence.I frequently briefed high level officals in miltiple branches of the military, allied forces and government 
                         officials. i was licky enough to attend some schools while in such as the Joint Human and Analytical Targeting Course (JHATC). Im glad that i got to enjoy those things 
                         but am very excited to be here taking this course. I want to expand on these skills and learn Python so i can get into Augmented reality and Virtual Reality.</p>
